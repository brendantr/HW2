# Deep Neural Network Implementation (HW2)

## Overview
This project implements a 5-layer deep neural network for multi-class classification as required for HW2. The implementation uses PyTorch and includes data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and experimental analysis.

## Files and Structure

### Part 1: Deep Neural Network Implementation (50 pts)

1. **Data Preprocessing**: `data_preprocessing.py`
   - Loads and combines data from all subdirectories
   - Uses columns 2-4 as input features and column 5 as labels
   - Implements 90/10 train/test split as required
   - Supports normalization with StandardScaler

2. **Model Architecture**: `model.py`
   - Implements a 5-layer neural network as required
   - Architecture: input → 64 → 32 → 16 → 8 → output
   - Supports both Xavier and random weight initialization
   - Uses ReLU activations between layers

3. **Training Implementation**: `train_model.py`
   - Contains the training loop for model optimization=
   - Tracks both training and validation losses
   - Provides visualization of the learning progress

4. **Main Program**: `main.py`
   - Orchestrates the entire workflow
   - Loads data, creates model, trains, and saves checkpoint
   - Exports the model as `model_checkpoint.pt` as required

5. **Evaluation**: 
   - `evaluate_model.py`: Contains evaluation metrics functions
   - `run_evaluation.py`: Tests the model on the 10% test data
   - Produces metrics: accuracy (95.5%), precision (95.1%), recall (95.5%), F1 score (94.6%)
   - Generates confusion matrix visualization

6. **Utilities**: `utils.py`
   - Contains helper functions for data loading and batch processing

### Part 2: Experimental Analysis (50 pts)

1. **Experiments Implementation**: `experiments.py`
   - Conducts experiments with different configurations
   - Saves results in the `experiment_results` directory

2. **Experiments Included**:
   - With/without normalization
   - Batch sizes (16 vs 64)
   - Learning rates (0.0001 vs 0.01)
   - Optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSProp, Momentum)
   - Weight initialization (Xavier vs Random)
   - L2 regularization impact

3. **Results Summary**: `experiment_results/summary.txt`
   - Contains performance metrics for all experiments
   - Includes runtime statistics and loss values

## How to Run

1. **Train the model**:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Evaluate the trained model**:
   ```
   python run_evaluation.py
   ```

3. **Run experiments**:
   ```
   python experiments.py
   ```

## Results

- Model achieves 95.5% accuracy on the test set
- Precision: 95.1%
- Recall: 95.5%
- F1 score: 94.6%
- Confusion matrix visualization saved as `confusion_matrix.png`

Experimental results demonstrate:
- Normalization improves model stability and reduces validation loss
- Smaller batch size (16) achieves higher F1 score (94.65%)
- Learning rate of 0.01 converges faster than 0.0001
- Adam optimizer outperforms other optimizers for this dataset
- Xavier initialization leads to faster convergence and better final performance
- Models without L2 regularization achieved better training performance on this dataset
